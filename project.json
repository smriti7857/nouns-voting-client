  "description": "A censorship-resistant governance client for Nouns DAO that I built while learning Web3 development. Unlike traditional DAO interfaces that rely on centralized servers, NounsVote is hosted entirely on IPFS and queries blockchain data directly through user-configurable RPC endpoints. Users can browse proposals, vote on governance decisions, and submit new proposals without depending on any centralized infrastructure. The app demonstrates true Web3 principles - no servers, no single points of failure, and complete user sovereignty over data sources.",
